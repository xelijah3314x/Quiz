# Quiz
Java testing with different classes!

How it works:
-Create school object
-School object creates a bunch of student objects
-Create a quiz object
-Randomly set quiz difficulty
-Students have a 'TakeQuiz' function
-The harder the quiz the less likely the student will pass
-Display everything in the console with colors

NOTE:
-The console uses ANSI colors so it might not work in some command lines!
