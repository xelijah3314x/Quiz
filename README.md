# Quiz\n
Java testing with different classes!\n
\n
How it works:\n
-Create school object\n
-School object creates a bunch of student objects\n
-Create a quiz object\n
-Randomly set quiz difficulty\n
-Students have a 'TakeQuiz' function\n
-The harder the quiz the less likely the student will pass\n
-Display everything in the console with colors\n
\n
NOTE:\n
-The console uses ANSI colors so it might not work in some command lines!\n
