# Quiz<br>
Java testing with different classes!<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
-Create school object<br>
-School object creates a bunch of student objects<br>
-Create a quiz object<br>
-Randomly set quiz difficulty<br>
-Students have a 'TakeQuiz' function<br>
-The harder the quiz the less likely the student will pass<br>
-Display everything in the console with colors<br>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
-The console uses ANSI colors so it might not work in some command lines!<br>
